   <p> I was in a building somewhere in the world. I think having a conversation with a stranger </p>
   <p> The building was on a coast because I could see the beach and the opening of the sea. stunning!</p>
   <p> I remember thinking about water sports and if anyone was swimming or going jet skiing </p>
   <p> Suddenly with the snap of a finger the stranger transported just me into the sea! </p>
   <p> I was miles away ! But I could still kind of see the island beach. I remember picnicking </p>
   <p> I called my friend and told her to save me by snapping her fingers</p>
   <p> I saw a post and started swimming towards it. My fear was something pulling me under... </p>
