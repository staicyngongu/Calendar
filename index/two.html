   <p> I was holding a little girl seemed to be my sister at the beginning 
   of the dream and then changed into her being my daughter. </p>
   <p> We were in prestige shopping center (my childhood mall) we were looking for snacks to share. </p>
   <p> We spoke in Japanese the whole dream. </p>
   <p> Suddenly she went missing after I put her down; I was really stressed trying to find her. </p>
    <p> I went upstairs to the manegement office and yelled at them to find her quickly </p>
   <p> In the end I found her at the end with an elderly woman and she ran over to hug me while crying.</p>
